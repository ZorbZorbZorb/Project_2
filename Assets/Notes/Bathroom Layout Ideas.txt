Maybe the reason why the restrooms feel so odd is because they're laid out like squares. I think that turning them into long slender rectangles horizontally would make them feel more natural. Try from left to right, sink sink urinal urinal toilet toilet toilet? Maybe that would work? It'll still have to be a little tall to account for the top-down perspective really being a front on perspective in a bastardization of isometcic style, taking the worst aspects of both but it'll be an improvement. Remember to set the size of the restroom in increments of the grid size, 140
