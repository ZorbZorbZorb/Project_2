Funds ideas

Maybe customers should gain increasing funds for how long they're in the bathroom, or how many drinks they've had, becoming more and more hard to manage and keep from peeing themselves. Customers could visually visit the counter and 'pay' by an emote when leaving, or not if they pee themselves.

Idk also like a lives system for wettings in the bar? these notes are really messy man.
Show hearts except its bladders up in the little menu holder thing that gets in the way of everything.

So to make funds worth wile there should be a limited number of nights in the game. 
Players should be incentivized to prioritize seating over relief options to generate more funds.

A high tier upgrade with a lot of funds would be to demolish the wall inbetween the mens and womens restoom, creating a unisex restroom. A short animation would play with a crashing sound effect and a fade to black, allowing the scene to secretly reload to an alternate scene with a unisex restroom.
This would also then allow for an expensive center of the restroom upgrade for something funny, like an ourinal. 
This is as close to a win condition that I can think up, and its also hilarious.
