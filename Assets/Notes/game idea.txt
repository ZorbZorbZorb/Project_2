I keep thinking about the idea of a game where you have to manage a bathroom and try to figure out how to order people to avoid accidents, you just have a waiting area, a few toilets, and a few urinals for far too many people who need to pee
Your waiting room has limited capacity and your goal is to avoid accidents, so you need to try to watch to see who is squirming/grabbing/dancing enough that they urgently need your bathroom, and then figure out among those what order to let them go and when
How many toilets and urinals to keep free in case someone bursting arrives, and who to just send away unrelieved because they don't need it badly enough yet

Realistic desperation engine
Tsuchigumo â€” 11/04/2020
Having to manage an adventuress-filled tavern and its restroom. Upgrading one side tends to mean the other sees more use (because bigger, fancier drinks), but maybe there's a bonus to having the restrooms used less... or maybe it's more trying to time cleaning periods, essentially locking it down for a set time as desperate girls pile up in wait-
Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
Well, the issue isn't that they use the bathroom, it's that if it's used it's not free for if someone desperate shows up, and you never know when that will be
so the incentive is to just decline anyone who isn't on the verge of losing it, anyone close you just make wait and maybe have one toilet you're letting people use
Making sure to keep loads of space free should one or more people seconds away from wetting shuffle in
Things getting more complicated with different bladder sizes and fill rates, so it's a good idea to throw someone who seems desperate just into your waiting area to see if it's actually getting worse and they need to go soon or if you can send them away since their desperation is manageable for a while

Making sure to keep loads of space free should one or more people seconds away from wetting shuffle in
Loving the implication of someone coming in knowing there's a toilet available but they can't use it just yet because they have to save it for someone who actually needs it
Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
yess
Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Actually
I might write something about that
Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
After waiting for several minutes, stalls sitting empty and urinals unused, but being kicked out of the bathroom because the waiting area is filling up, squirming and grabbing yourself
Told to come back no sooner than 30 minutes from now to be re-assessed
Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Back to drinking, of course
No reason to stop if you don't need to be anywhere else
Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
The only public bathroom in an area full of bars
Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Anywhere else you could go obviously has a minimum amount of drinks you have to buy first
Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
Making it so much harder to judge because your only information is how long since they last got to go
Oh, none of those places have bathrooms, this is all of their bathrooms
Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Well, yeah, of course, the signs everywhere else advertising one with a four-drink minimum are really old
Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
Just 5 toilets, 3 urinals, and a waiting area; up to you to determine who needs to go
Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
someone forgot to take them down
Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
Or they need to submit drink tickets from any of the bars to prove they are a customer to get into the waiting room
So if you turn them away, even though they felt bursting, they not only have to wait 30 minutes before coming back but they need to have a drink to get back in to the waiting room to find out if they can be allowed to go then
Sometimes you get rushes of people, and you have to kick people out of the waiting room you'd had there for a while who were really desperate, knowing fully well they won't make it even 5 minutes, but you need the space urgently to minimize the number of wettings

Nomnomcat â€” 11/04/2020
"Please, I need it now or I'm going to wet myself!"
"Better you than three others, now step aside please"

Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Clearly there's also a time limit on the waiting room, since if you can wait that long you don't need it yet so you should make room for someone else

OasisOnLock â€” 11/04/2020
Pay for too much time in the waiting room

Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
A capacity limit so you have incentive to keep space free, since it automatically rejects people if it's full
[7:37 PM]
And that could be people who need it more urgently than people in your waiting room
[7:37 PM]
So if you suspect they could hold it you send them away to keep space ready in case someone has to go worse

Pobbs â€” 11/04/2020
This sounds incredible, actually
[7:59 PM]
I seriously want to play this

Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
As an added management thing you could get to upgrade the bathroom between days, your income being the number of people admitted to the waiting area minus a penalty for people who wet themselves

Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Cleaning fees and such

Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
And you have to use that budget to improve your bathroom's capacity

Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
tbh I'm reminded of Papers, Please

Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
Giving you choices, expanding the room itself has a cost, toilets are expensive and take up space but obviously work for the most cases, urinals take up less room and are faster to use but are only useful for boys and the most desperate of girls since they'll only actually use them in front of everyone if they are imminently about to lose it(edited)
[8:07 PM]
Things like buckets are cheap but you can only use them a few times a night before they are full
[8:08 PM]
Having to balance budgeting money and space for toilets and urinals for your normal usage while having to think about surge demand and having sinks and buckets you could use if things get bad

Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
Finding strange cost-optimized strategies like removing all toilets and just having towels to give to girls who won't last long enough to get you another admission if you send them away still holding

Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
Maximizing waiting room space and only having a single toilet and urinal and just buckets for immediate needs, hoping to run out the clock to closing time on as many bladders as possible in the waiting room

Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
I dunno, buckets sound kinda big, little too expensive

Tsuchigumo â€” 11/04/2020
Just use a big bottle. A big, full bottle, so they have to drink before using it-

Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Get a whole package of water bottles to save money by buying in bulk
[8:29 PM]
hand them out to people who need them so they can drink and then use them

(waiting for the coversation to fully end to take notes and see if it's something that can be done within a week)(edited)

Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Could definitely at least have a proof-of-concept running in a week

Tsuchigumo â€” 11/04/2020
when do we open the bottle-recycling-gacha that might open the bathroom door in exchange for an empty bottle, but is much more likely to just screw the girl out of relief after drinking more

Lewdgoat â€” 11/04/2020
I mean this has been veering off from the basic idea of just sorting desperate people and managing toilet availability

Tsuchigumo â€” 11/04/2020
that's true-

Sake, Lord of Rice â€” 11/04/2020
Ye the basic concept should be super easy to slap together in RPGmaker or something just to have something working

I actually ended up drawing the one I got (although slightly different from the actual prompt) and two other pieces

A weird idea bouncing around in my skull
[4:25 AM]
Girl who canâ€™t pee as long as sheâ€™s wearing panties
[4:26 AM]
If she takes them off, she has to wait an hour before being able to go

Bombality â€” 11/08/2020
Oh

'wings â€” 11/08/2020
Donâ€™t know why that would be the case - rare allergy or psychological phenomena
[4:27 AM]
The explanation doesnâ€™t really matter

Phen â€” 11/08/2020
Maybe sheâ€™s only developed the allergy recently, and her schedule is spread out throughout the day so that everything she does is an hour apart, so despite having plenty of free time between everything she does, she canâ€™t pee until sheâ€™s done with everything

ðŸ’¦ðŸ’›(P)eeveeðŸ’›ðŸ’¦ â€” 11/08/2020
Okay so like
[10:18 PM]
Imagine someone is masturbating and thinks they're going to cum, but then they end up peeing instead and are just super embarrassed as they clean the sheets. Or better yet, they decide to finish while laying in their pee.
